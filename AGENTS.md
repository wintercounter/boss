# AGENTS

Start here:
- Read `docs/AI_OVERVIEW.md` for repo orientation and key paths.
- Read `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the plugin pipeline and runtime flow.
- Read `docs/AI_WORKFLOWS.md` for common change patterns and testing notes.
- For user-facing behavior/docs, prefer the website docs in `website/docs/` (`https://bosscss.com/docs`).

Quick context:
- Source code lives in `src/`.
- The sample Next.js app is in `test/sample/nextjs/` and includes a `.bo$$/` config + generated runtime.
- Generated outputs (e.g., `.bo$$/`, `dist/`) are not hand-edited; change the source generators instead.

# IMPORTANT RULES
- Docs always needs to be updated alongside code changes.
